YIB
===

YIB stands for '''Y'''HC '''I'''RC '''B'''ot and is a planned project that has not started yet. The idea is that the bot will always be connected to the YHC [[IRC]] channel.

The bot can be addressed by using it's prefix character before the command '''!''' eg. '''!time'''.

== Current Features ==
* None (not for long, buddy!)


== Planned Features ==
* Chat logging and publishing
* Running events
* Auto recompile on git push to repository
* Using [https://travis-ci.org/ Travis.ci] for integration and testing before pushing to master
* Useful utilities like:
** Time
** Seen
** Help
** Games
** Tell/Msg
* More to come, feel free to post ideas in the disscusion page


== Timeline ==
Initial work has begun on the bot and we will be publishing and beta-testing a pre-release very soon. 

The first steps will be to get the auto compiling and [https://travis-ci.org/ Travis.ci] integration working, then we should be able to get things happening rather quickly with all of us working at once.


== Git repository and coding guidelines ==
The [https://github.com/Youth-Hackers-Club/YIB/ git-repo] is on github, currently empty. Once there is enough base code I'll push the initial commit and start testing the CI.

As for coding guidelines, just stick to making the code look nice and follow standard practices. If you submit a pull request, we'll let you know what needs to change before we'll merge.
